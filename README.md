## Sudoku CLI 

A command line interface built in C++, allowing a choice of sudokus (easy, medium, hard, worlds hardest) to solve. Also includes a basic depth-first solver. 

I wrote this as an exercise in C++ fundamentals, and object-oriented programming.

### Prerequisites
- C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., `g++` or `clang++`)

### Build instructions

Compile:
`clang++ -std=c++17 -o main main.cpp sudoku.cpp sudoku_cli_display.cpp`

### Usage

Run compiled executable:
`./main`
